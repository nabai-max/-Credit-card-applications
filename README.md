# Automated Credit Card Approval Predictor

This project aims to automate the process of credit card application approvals using machine learning techniques, similar to practices employed by commercial banks. By leveraging the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we undertake the following steps:

- **Data Loading and Viewing**: Initial exploration of the dataset, highlighting its numerical, non-numerical features, varying ranges, and missing entries.
- **Preprocessing**: Preparing the dataset for machine learning model compatibility.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Gaining insights to guide our modeling strategy.
- **Model Building**: Developing a machine learning model to predict credit card application outcomes.

Through this project, we streamline the approval process, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual errors.
